我对金钱一无所知。除了高收益储蓄账户外，我还应该做什么吗？

Could keep its simple with Vti/vxus.
可以使用 Vti/vxus 保持简单。

Set up a Roth as well if you don’t have one already
如果您还没有 Roth，也要设置

2. 


Figure out how much it costs you to maintain your life per month. Set aside 3 - 6 months worth of funds as an emergency fund. The amount should be based on your risk tolerance and job security. If you think you could be out of work for a long time, larger emergency fund is likely needed.
弄清楚您每月要花多少钱来维持自己的生活。留出 3 - 6 个月的资金作为应急基金。金额应根据您的风险承受能力和工作保障。如果您认为自己可能会长时间失业，则可能需要更大的应急基金。

Depending on your income, create and fund a roth ira. Purchase a fund that tracks the S&P500. This account has limits in the amount you can deposit per year. Set it and forget about it.
根据您的收入，创建并资助 roth ira。购买跟踪 S&P500 的基金。此账户对您每年可以存入的金额有限制。设置它并忘记它。

Make sure youre getting the full match from your employers retirement plan. If you can afford to, consider contributing more than the match.
确保您从雇主退休计划中获得完全匹配。如果您负担得起，请考虑贡献比匹配更多的贡献。

Then if all is well, set goals for what you want. Short term goals should have money saved in a HYSA or T-Bills.
然后，如果一切顺利，就为你想要的东西设定目标。短期目标应该将钱存入 HYSA 或 T-Bills。

Longer term goals can invest the money in a brokerage account. Best course is to pick the S&P500 again.
长期目标可以将资金投资于经纪账户。最好的办法是再次选择 S&P500。

I'd suggest doing some research on different products and offerings. Have fun!

A HYSA is a shortterm solution, not a longterm plan
HYSA 是一个短期解决方案，而不是长期计划
