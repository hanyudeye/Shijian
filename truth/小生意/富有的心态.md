When I was a Freshman at [BYU](http://byu.edu/) (I’m currently a [Senior](https://instagram.com/p/1KDadMQ8yY/)), I took a class titled _Intro to Entrepreneurship_. This was my first exposure to the world of business and startups. Our [professor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnrichards) would invite seasoned entrepreneurs and successful business professionals to speak to our class.  
当我还是[杨百翰大学](http://byu.edu/)的新生时（我现在是[大四学生](https://instagram.com/p/1KDadMQ8yY/)），我上了一门名_为创业入门的_课程。这是我第一次接触到商业和创业的世界。我们[的教授](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnrichards)会邀请经验丰富的企业家和成功的商业专业人士来给我们上课。

As a young inexperienced human, I was hoping they would impress me (even make me jealous) and then teach me how to achieve a life similar to theirs. BUT it didn’t really happen like that. More so, it just confused me. I hoped to hear how their financial success in life afforded them more freedom, better health, greater relationships with family and friends, and incredible travels and life experiences. Instead, they would choose to speak about their revenues from the previous year, how many employees they added the past month, or the crazy long hours they put in at work or even their commute to and from. Gross.  
作为一个没有经验的年轻人，我希望他们能给我留下深刻的印象（甚至让我嫉妒），然后教我如何实现与他们相似的生活。但事实并非如此。更重要的是，这让我感到困惑。我希望听到他们在生活中的经济成功如何给他们带来更多的自由，更好的健康，与家人和朋友更好的关系，以及令人难以置信的旅行和生活经历。相反，他们会选择谈论他们前一年的收入，他们在过去一个月增加了多少员工，或者他们在工作中投入的疯狂的长时间，甚至他们的通勤。恶心

This made me wonder if they were always like that, or if somewhere along the way they “[grew up](https://youtu.be/05fjG3dQdsU)” and their priorities changed.  
这让我想知道他们是不是一直都是这样，或者是不是在他们“[成长](https://youtu.be/05fjG3dQdsU)“的过程中的某个沿着，他们的优先事项发生了变化。

I decided I did not want to be a businessman. At least not that kind. I began to make a list in my journal of notes to my future self. Things that would help remind me later in life of my cares and priorities at a younger age. Maybe, someday I would look back at these notes and think they were foolish. OR, maybe they would save me.  
我决定我不想成为一个商人。至少不是那种我开始在日记里给未来的自己列一个笔记清单。这些事情会帮助我在以后的生活中提醒我年轻时的关心和优先事项。也许，有一天我会回头看这些笔记，觉得它们很愚蠢。或者，也许他们会救我。

## Scan : a dorm room succe$$  
扫描：一个宿舍成功$$

During that Freshman year, 2 of my schoolmates and I started a side project we called, [Scan](https://angel.co/scan). Those 2 schoolmates were [Ben Turley](http://twitter.com/benturley) and [Kirk Ouimet](http://twitter.com/kirkouimet). That fun project “matured” into a [startup](https://angel.co/scan) and 3 years later, became the bearer of sweet financial fruits for us, our [team](http://scan.me/about), and our [investors](https://angel.co/scan). I still remember that early day in Kirk Ouimet’s dorm room when we set our first (and last) “company goals”. Although they seemed lofty at the time, we thought it would be stellar to achieve :  
在大学一年级的时候，我和两个同学开始了一个叫“[扫描”的](https://angel.co/scan)副业。这两个同学是[本·特利](http://twitter.com/benturley)和[柯克·奥密特](http://twitter.com/kirkouimet)。这个有趣的项目“成熟”成了一[个创业公司](https://angel.co/scan)，3年后，成为我们、我们[的团队](http://scan.me/about)和我们[的投资者](https://angel.co/scan)的甜蜜财务果实的承载者。我仍然记得在Kirk Ouimet宿舍的那一天，我们设定了第一个（也是最后一个）“公司目标”。虽然他们当时看起来很崇高，但我们认为这将是恒星实现：

-   1 million+ downloads 超过100万次下载
-   $5,000 dollars profit 5,000美元利润

Well, we achieved our goals : ) Our app eventually surpassed 100 million downloads and..$5,000? Yea, we surpa$$ed that guy too..  
好吧，我们实现了我们的目标：）我们的应用程序最终超过1亿次下载和..$五千块是的，我们也超过了那个艾德。

## Does money change people?  
金钱会改变人吗？

Personally, I’m beginning to think that money doesn’t change people, rather, money exposes people. It brings out the best. It brings out the worst. It brings out characteristics that were already there. Deep down. When Scan brought money into our lives, more money than we had expected, some very interesting things were exposed.  
就我个人而言，我开始认为金钱不会改变人，相反，金钱暴露了人。它能激发出最好的一面。它会把最坏的东西带出来。它展现了已经存在的特征。内心深处当扫描带钱进入我们的生活，比我们预期的更多的钱，一些非常有趣的事情被曝光。

Truth be told, there’s a surprising number of people who go out of their way to point out that we’re still very far from rich. That’s nonsense. “Rich” is a relative and opinion-based adjective which is mostly based on each individual’s level of gratitude towards life. So to be transparent with you, both about my financial situation and my current level of gratitude in life : We are rich : )  
说实话，有很多人不厌其烦地指出，我们离富裕还很远。那是胡说。“富有”是一个相对的、基于观点的形容词，主要基于每个人对生活的感恩程度。所以要对你透明，关于我的财务状况和我目前的生活感激程度：我们很富有：）

## The purpose of life 生活的目的

Kirk Ouimet(1 of my cofounders at Scan) has become a very close friend. The amount of joy he added to the journey of our first startup venture was priceless. He’s probably the best conversationalists on the planet. (Anyone reading this who knows him just chuckled in agreement ; ) He has a way of putting life into perspective and making you think about things in a way you never have before.  
Kirk Ouimet（我在Scan的联合创始人之一）已经成为一个非常亲密的朋友。他为我们的第一次创业之旅带来的欢乐是无价的。他可能是这个星球上最好的健谈者。（任何阅读这篇文章的人只要认识他，就会笑着表示同意;）他有一种把生活放进视角的方法，让你以一种你从未有过的方式思考事情。

During our college days, the system would tell us to focus and work towards a career. Advisors would tell us that in order to be successful we should get good grades, do internships, get a degree, and then hopefully we will land a job that puts food on the table for us and our families. But what happens when we’ve “accomplished” that goal? Or beat that system altogether? If our 9–5 isn’t about earning a living anymore, then what is it about?  
在我们的大学时代，系统会告诉我们要专注于一份职业。顾问会告诉我们，为了成功，我们应该取得好成绩，做实习，获得学位，然后希望我们能找到一份工作，为我们和我们的家庭提供食物。但是，当我们“完成”这个目标时，会发生什么呢？或者彻底打败这个系统？如果朝九晚五不再是为了谋生，那是为了什么？

Kirk brought up the question : “Who is wealthier? A man with billion$ but no love? Or a man with less money but a happy marriage?” Immediately this reminded me of that list I had started many years back as a Freshman.  
柯克提出了一个问题：“谁更富有？一个拥有十亿美元却没有爱情的男人？还是一个钱少但婚姻幸福的男人？”这立刻让我想起了多年前我作为一名大一新生开始列出的清单。

So Kirk, here is the plan. We got rich. Now, let’s go get wealthy.  
柯克，计划是这样的我们发财了。我们去发财吧。
